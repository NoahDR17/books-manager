  The code responsible for this feature is located in the `create_book_for_library(library)`. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:

  - **User Input**: Prompts the user to input details such as the book's name, author, number of pages, and price.
  - **Input Validation**: Ensures that inputs for pages (integer) and price (float) are valid numeric values.
  - **Book Creation**: Constructs a `Book` object using the provided details.
  - **Library Interaction**: Calls `library.add_book(new_book)` to add the newly created book to the library instance.
  - **Google Sheets Update**: Automatically updates the associated Google Sheet (`update_google_sheet()` method in `Library` class) to reflect the addition of the new book.

- **Value to the User**:
  Users benefit from a straightforward process to input and catalog new books into their digital library, ensuring that their collection remains organized and accessible.

- ![Add](./docs/features/add-feat.png)
#### 2. Searching for a Book

  - **List Display**: Iterates through `self.books` and prints each book's details using their `__str__` method.
  - **Empty Library Handling**: If there are no books (`self.books` is empty), it notifies the user that the library is empty.

- **Value to the User**:
  Provides users with a comprehensive overview of their entire book collection, facilitating easier management and reference.

- ![View](./docs/features/view-feat.png)

#### 4. Removing a Book

# Database Design

The database for the Books Manager project leverages Google Sheets as the primary storage mechanism for all book-related data. This approach is chosen for its simplicity, accessibility, and ease of integration with Python. Below is a detailed overview of the database design, including the structure of the Google Sheet and how the data is organized.

## Why Google Sheets?

### Benefits:
- **Ease of Use**: Google Sheets provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface that requires minimal setup.
- **Accessibility**: Data stored in Google Sheets can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.
- **Integration**: Google Sheets API allows seamless integration with Python, enabling easy data manipulation and retrieval.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple users can access and update the data simultaneously, making it ideal for collaborative projects.

## Database Structure

**Google Sheet Name**: `books_manager`

**Columns**:
1. **Book Name**: The name of the book.
2. **Author**: The author of the book.
3. **Pages**: The number of pages in the book.
4. **Price**: The price of the book.

Each row in the Google Sheet represents a single book record. The columns store specific attributes of the book, providing a structured format for data storage and retrieval.

## Google Sheet Layout

| Book Name           | Author             | Pages | Price  |
|---------------------|--------------------|-------|--------|
| The Great Gatsby    | F. Scott Fitzgerald| 180   | 10.99  |
| 1984                | George Orwell      | 328   | 8.99   |

[Python Validated](./docs/testing/python-valid.png)

### Bugs and Fixes
- **Issue**: Duplicate Book Entries
- **Description**:
  - Users were able to add multiple books with the same name into the library, causing duplication in the database.
- **Solution**: 
  - Issue left unchanged as it would make sense to allow there to be more than one of the same books in someones collection.
