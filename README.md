### Features

#### 1. Adding a Book

- **Feature Description**: 
  This feature allows users to add a new book to their library through a prompt-based interface.

- **Code Reference**: 
  The code responsible for this feature is located in the `create_book_for_library(library)`. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:
  
  - **User Input**: Prompts the user to input details such as the book's name, author, number of pages, and price.
  - **Input Validation**: Ensures that inputs for pages (integer) and price (float) are valid numeric values.
  - **Book Creation**: Constructs a `Book` object using the provided details.
  - **Library Interaction**: Calls `library.add_book(new_book)` to add the newly created book to the library instance.
  - **Google Sheets Update**: Automatically updates the associated Google Sheet (`update_google_sheet()` method in `Library` class) to reflect the addition of the new book.

- **Value to the User**:
  Users benefit from a straightforward process to input and catalog new books into their digital library, ensuring that their collection remains organized and accessible.

#### 2. Searching for a Book

- **Feature Description**:
  This feature enables users to search for a specific book by its title within the library.

- **Code Reference**:
  The search functionality is implemented in the `search_for_book(library)` function.
  
  - **User Input**: Prompts the user to enter the name of the book they wish to search for.
  - **Search Logic**: Iterates through the list of books (`self.books` in `Library` class) and compares each book's title (case-insensitive) with the user input.
  - **Output**: Returns details of the book if found (`__str__` method in `Book` class) or a message indicating the book is not in the library.

- **Value to the User**:
  Users can quickly retrieve information about specific books without manually scanning through their entire collection, enhancing efficiency and usability.

#### 3. Viewing All Books

- **Feature Description**:
  This feature displays all books currently stored in the library.

- **Code Reference**:
  Implemented in the `display_books()` method of the `Library` class.
  
  - **List Display**: Iterates through `self.books` and prints each book's details using their `__str__` method.
  - **Empty Library Handling**: If there are no books (`self.books` is empty), it notifies the user that the library is empty.

- **Value to the User**:
  Provides users with a comprehensive overview of their entire book collection, facilitating easier management and reference.

#### 4. Removing a Book

- **Feature Description**:
  Allows users to remove a book from their library.

- **Code Reference**:
  The removal functionality is handled in the `remove_book(library)` function.
  
  - **User Input**: Prompts the user to enter the name of the book they want to remove.
  - **Book Removal**: Finds the book by its title (case-insensitive) in `self.books` and removes it.
  - **Google Sheets Update**: Updates the Google Sheet (`update_google_sheet()` method in `Library` class) to reflect the removal of the book.

- **Value to the User**:
  Enables users to maintain an up-to-date library by removing books they no longer wish to keep, ensuring accurate cataloging and management.

#### 5. Quitting the Program

- **Feature Description**:
  Provides an option for users to exit the program.

- **Code Reference**:
  Handled within the `quit_program()` function.
  
  - **User Confirmation**: Prompts the user to confirm their intention to quit the program (`'y'` for yes, `'n'` for no).
  - **Exit**: Calls `exit()` to terminate the program if the user confirms.

- **Value to the User**:
  Offers a straightforward way to gracefully exit the application once users have completed their tasks, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
